trunk/app should contain only the files needed for the actual Google App
Engine application "image".  Support code that is not part of the application
image belongs elsewhere, such as in trunk/scripts, for example.

= THIRD PARTY CODE =

Third-party code that is *not* part of the application image (the Google App
Engine SDK in trunk/thirdparty/google_appengine, for example) belongs in
trunk/thirdparty (see also trunk/thirdparty/README).

Third-party code that is part of the application image is placed in a package
subdirectory in trunk/app, such as trunk/app/django, for example.

If the third-party package is a single Python source file, place the code in
trunk/app/<package>/__init__.py, so that it can simply be imported using,
for example:

import feedparser

(The trunk/app/feedparser package is a good example of this approach.)

== THIRD PARTY LICENSES ==

Third-party code must also include a license text file, named LICENSE or
COPYING, in the package subdirectory.  If the third-party package subdirectory
is maintained automatically with a tool such as svn_load_dirs.pl (which
removes files, such as license text files, that were added later to the
"target" directory), place the license text file in the trunk/app directory
and add the package name as a suffix (LICENSE.django is an example of this
case).
