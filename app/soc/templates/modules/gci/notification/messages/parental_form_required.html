*Any one of following documents is considered acceptable proof
 of enrollment:<br/>
-a scanned copy of your student identification card that shows
 you were enrolled as of 22 November 2010.  This means the card
 must show the date (a 2010 or later expiration date or some kind
 of indication of enrollment in the 2009/2010 is fine, but the
 date you started is alone not enough)<br/>
-a transcript or course list (official or unofficial is fine)
 showing the courses you were enrolled in as of 22 November 2010.
 Transcript in .txt format is NOT acceptable.<br/>
-a letter from your student affairs or admissions office stating
 that you were enrolled as of 22 November 2010.<br/>
