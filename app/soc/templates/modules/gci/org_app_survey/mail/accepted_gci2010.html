<p>
Congratulations, your application for {{ org_app_name }} as a mentoring organization for {{ program_name }} has been accepted!
Over the next few days, you should plan to register your mentors and complete some housekeeping tasks to make sure your pages on the GCI 2010 site are up to date.
Please read this email very carefully, as it contains important instructions for you and your organization.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing to do right now is to check your email for an invitation to become an organization administrator. If you do not do this, it will *not* be possible for anyone to apply to become a mentor (as there is no adminstrator to approve them)! You should have received a <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/notification/list">notification</a> (the same as an email too) about this. If you cannot find the notification, you can find the invitation under your <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/user/requests">requests</a>. Again, please do this *now*.
</p>

<p>
For more information on registering your mentors and other/alternate administrators, please see the site 
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2010/gciusermanual">User Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>Once again, congratulations for your acceptance into {{ program_name }}!</p>
