<p>
Congratulations, your application for {{ org_app_name }} as a mentoring organization for {{ program_name }} has been accepted!
Over the next few days, you should plan to register your mentors and complete some housekeeping tasks to make sure your pages on the GSoC 2010 site are up to date.
Please read this email very carefully, as it contains important instructions for you and your organization.
</p>

<p>
For more information on registering your mentors and other/alternate administrators, please see the site 
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/userguide">User Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
You should immediately plan to update your accepted organization profile and to create your organization's home page
at socghop.appspot.com. You can find instructions for this in the <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/userguide#depth_orgadmins">User Guide:
Organization Administrators</a> section. Please do this *now*, as it ensure that would-be student applicants have the best access to your organization's information.
</p>

<p>
We will periodically subscribe mentors who sign up with your organization to the program's 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-mentors-list">private mentors mailing list</a>.
Please let your mentors know to expect this. Please also let them know that they may be resubscribed a few times if they
choose to unsubscribe and we apologize in advance if this occurs. It may be worth setting the mailing list preferences
to digest only for the few days of the program.
</p> 

<p>Once again, congratulations for your acceptance into {{ program_name }}!</p>
