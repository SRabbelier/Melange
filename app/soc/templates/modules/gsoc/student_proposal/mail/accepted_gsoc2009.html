<p>
Congratulations! Your proposal "{{ proposal_title }}" as submitted to "{{ org_name }}" 
has been accepted for {{ program_name }}. Over the next few days, we will add 
you to the private Google Summer of Code Student Discussion List. Over the next few 
weeks, we will send instructions to this list regarding turn in proof of enrollment, 
tax forms, etc.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've been accepted, please take the opportunity to speak with your mentors 
about plans for the Community Bonding Period: what documentation should you be 
reading, what version control system will you need to set up, etc., before start of 
coding begins on May 23rd.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to {{ program_name }}! We look forward to having you with us.
