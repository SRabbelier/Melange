<p>
  Your "{{ org_app_name }}" organization application for {{ program_name }} has been
  accepted. Please take a moment *now* to log in to
  {{ HTTP_host }} and review your Notifications (accessible in the
  left hand navigation menu). You will need to follow the instructions
  provided there to finish updating your organization's profile and to create
  a home page for your organization on {{ HTTP_host }}. These changes
  must be taken care of *immediately* so that student applicants have access
  to the necessary information they'll require to review your organization
  before applying.
</p>

<p>
  You will now also be able to review and accept mentor applications for your
  organization.
</p>

Congratulations! We look forward to having you with us for {{ program_name }}.
