Melange taggable module
Copyright 2008-2009 Adam Crossland and Melange authors.

This software contains code derived from the taggable-mixin open source project developed by Adam Crossland.

Melange developers and contributors have introduced various modifications. The most significant ones are listed below:

- tag_property function added; its purpose is to support more than one tag per data model
- Taggable class serves as tags container
- scope property added to the Tag model; most class methods are extended to support that field
- auto_delete property added to the Tag model in order to automatically get rid of unused tag instances
