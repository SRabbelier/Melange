Package: tla-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), tla, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into tla/arch
 Tom Lord's arch/tla system is capable of importing upstream directories
 into a tla archive for some archives.  For situations where the upstream
 renames or moves files and directories on a regular basis, version
 information can be lost.
 .
 tla-load-dirs works with tla to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs.

Package: darcs-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), darcs, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into darcs
 Darcs works fine for importing new archives.  However, for situations
 where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
 basis, version information can be lost.
 .
 darcs-load-dirs works with darcs to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs or my tla_load_dirs package for Arch.

Package: hg-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), mercurial, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into darcs
 Mercurial works fine for importing new archives.  However, for situations
 where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
 basis, version information can be lost.
 .
 hg-load-dirs works with darcs to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs or my tla_load_dirs package for Arch.

Package: baz-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), bazaar, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into baz
 Bazaar (baz) works fine for importing new archives.  However, for situations
 where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
 basis, version information can be lost.
 .
 baz-load-dirs works with baz to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs or my tla_load_dirs package for tla.

Package: svk-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), svk, ${shlibs:Depends} ${misc:Depends} ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into svk
 Svk works fine for importing new archives.  However, for situations
 where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
 basis, version information can be lost.
 .
 svk-load-dirs works with svk to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs or my tla_load_dirs package for tla.

Package: git-load-dirs
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: load-dirs-common (= ${Source-Version}), git-core, ${shlibs:Depends} ${misc:Depends} ${python:Depends}
Description: Import upstream archives into git
 Git works fine for importing new archives.  However, for situations
 where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
 basis, version information can be lost.
 .
 git-load-dirs works with git to import these things and preserve
 changes.  It works on a principle similar to Subversion's
 svn_load_dirs or my tla_load_dirs package for tla.

Package: load-dirs-common
Architecture: all
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Conflicts: tla-load-dirs (<< 1.0.14)
Description: Common files for tla-load-dirs and darcs-load-dirs
 These two packages share much common code.  This package provides
 that common code so you don't have to install it twice on your system.
